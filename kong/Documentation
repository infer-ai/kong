1.	New file has been created in kong->core->custom_error_handlers.lua
	It handles the error which occurs at Nginx.
	Any error which occurs at Upstream Server will be directly propagated to client.

	In custom_error_handler.lua:
	1. We can set the message template.
	2. All the error messages based on response status code which is need to be passed to client is set in kong->error_messages.lua

2.	Some of the error messages are also sent by various plugins in Kong.
	We have use plugins like
	1. kong->plugins->key-auth
	2. kong->plugins->acl

	All the business processing is done in handler.lua file of each plugin.

	Error messages of above said plugins also have been mapped in error_messages.lua file.

	If any more changes are required to be done in plugins. Following are the steps:
	1.	Add local error_messages = require "kong.error_messages" at the top of the file (handler.lua)
	2.	Add error message to be sent in error_message.lua file in "key = value" format.
	3.	Map the error message at the desired place in plugin using error_messages["key"].

	Note: All the plugins uses kong->tools->responses.lua file to send their response to client. If any changes like template changes has to be made, it should be made in above said file.
